            <h3>Tinkering</h3>
            <img id="maker" src="img/makerspace.jpg">
            <p>I am a maker. You see this in my professional life as I work on developing new and exciting projects. I also enjoy carpentry, metalurgy, 3d printing and electronics. My favorite projects combine these interests. I am particularly proud of creating my own custom lightsaber. I hope to someday help open a local makerspace here near my home.</p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <img id= "brass" src="img/brass.jpg">
            <p>Tubas and Trumpets and Trombones! Oh my! I have been a musician since I was ten years old. I enjoy playing in ensembles and community symphonies. I have learned to play the entire brass intrument family as well as some piano, clarinet, and guitar. I played Tuba and Trombone at Snow College on a full tuition performance scholarship. One of my favorite traditions around the holidays is performing in Handel's Messiah with a community orchestra each December.</p>
