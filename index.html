        <p>As a life long enthusiast in the technology sector, it is time to align my career with my passion. I am a leader among my peers and am driven to excellence in all I do. I am a current student in Web Development to flush-out my skillset before I enter the job market.</p>
        <p>My family is the reason behind everything I do. I am seeking a sustainable work-life balance that allows me to succeed in my professional goals while allowing plenty of time to be active in the lives of my wife and children.
